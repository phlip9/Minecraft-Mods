Build Instructions:
-------------------

1. Have Java, MCP, and Eclipse properly set up. Instructions can be found here: http://mcp.ocean-labs.de/
2. Clean the MCP build environment (hint: use clean.bat for Windows and clean.sh for Mac/Linux.)
3. Decompile minecraft with decompile.(bat/sh) *Note* Make sure you have Modloader installed in the minecraft.jar you are decompiling!
4. Copy the files from the source directory of the mod you wish to build.
5. Paste these files into the src/minecraft/net/minecraft/src folder.
6. Now, open up eclipse. Set your working directory to your_mcp_directory/eclipse.
7. Edit to your hearts content! When you want to run the client, simply hit the run button in eclipse.
